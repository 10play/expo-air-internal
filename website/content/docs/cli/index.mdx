## `expo-air init`

Initialize expo-air in your project. Creates configuration files and runs prebuild.

```bash
npx expo-air init
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing configuration files |
| `--skip-prebuild` | Skip running `expo prebuild` after init |

## `expo-air start`

Start the full development environment — prompt server, widget Metro, app Metro, and tunnels.

```bash
npx expo-air start [options]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port <number>` | `3847` | Prompt server WebSocket port |
| `--widget-port <number>` | `8082` | Widget Metro dev server port |
| `--metro-port <number>` | `8081` | App Metro dev server port |
| `--no-tunnel` | — | Skip tunnel setup (local network only) |
| `--no-build` | — | Skip building the app |
| `--no-server` | — | Skip starting the WebSocket server |

## `expo-air fly`

Build, install on a real iOS device, and start everything with Cloudflare tunnels. Use this when your device is not on the same network.

```bash
npx expo-air fly
```

This command:
1. Allocates ports for all three servers
2. Creates Cloudflare tunnels for remote access
3. Updates `.expo-air.local.json` with tunnel URLs
4. Builds and installs the app on your connected device
5. Starts the prompt server and both Metro instances

## `expo-air dev`

SDK development mode — runs the widget with live source changes on the simulator. Primarily used for developing expo-air itself.

```bash
npx expo-air dev
```

## `expo-air server`

Run only the prompt server without launching Metro or building the app. Useful when you want to manage Metro separately.

```bash
npx expo-air server
```
