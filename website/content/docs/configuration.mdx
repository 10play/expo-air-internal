## `.expo-air.json`

The main configuration file, created by `expo-air init`. Committed to git.

```json
{
  "autoShow": true,
  "ui": {
    "bubbleSize": 60,
    "bubbleColor": "#007AFF"
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `autoShow` | `boolean` | `true` | Automatically show the widget when the app launches (DEBUG only) |
| `ui.bubbleSize` | `number` | `60` | Size of the floating bubble in pixels |
| `ui.bubbleColor` | `string` | `"#007AFF"` | Bubble color as a hex string |
| `envFile` | `string` | — | Path to an env file where extra tunnel URLs are written |
| `extraTunnels` | `ExtraTunnelConfig[]` | — | Additional local services to tunnel (see [Extra Tunnels](/docs/remote-development#extra-tunnels)) |

## `.expo-air.local.json`

Auto-generated file containing tunnel URLs for the current dev session. **Gitignored** — do not edit manually.

```json
{
  "serverUrl": "wss://random-name.trycloudflare.com",
  "widgetMetroUrl": "https://random-name.trycloudflare.com",
  "appMetroUrl": "https://random-name.trycloudflare.com"
}
```

This file is regenerated every time you run `expo-air start` or `expo-air fly`. The config plugin reads these URLs and writes them into `Info.plist` during prebuild.

## Config plugin

Added to your `app.json` during initialization:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@10play/expo-air"]
}
```

The plugin handles:

- **AppDelegate patching** — Overrides `bundleURL()` in DEBUG to load from tunnel URLs
- **HMR reconnect injection** — Injects `@10play/expo-air/build/hmrReconnect` import into your app entry
- **Info.plist configuration** — Writes all expo-air settings under an `ExpoAir` key
- **ATS exceptions** — Allows HTTPS connections to `trycloudflare.com`, `loca.lt`, and `bore.pub`

## Environment variables

Override config values with environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EXPO_AIR_METRO_URL` | Override the widget Metro server URL |
| `EXPO_AIR_SERVER_URL` | Override the WebSocket server URL |
