expo-air brings AI-powered development directly to your device. Send prompts to Claude from a floating widget on your phone, and watch your code change in real-time through Expo Metro hot reload.

## What you get

- **On-device widget** — A native floating overlay for sending prompts without leaving your app
- **Claude-powered coding** — Full agentic code generation via the Claude Agent SDK
- **Real-time updates** — Changes appear instantly through Metro HMR
- **Git integration** — View diffs, switch branches, commit, and create PRs from the widget

<Callout type="info">
expo-air is development-only. All native code is wrapped in `#if DEBUG` guards — zero impact on your production builds. No SDK code ships to your users.
