## Start the dev environment

After [installing](/docs/installation) expo-air, start everything with one command:

```bash
npx expo-air start
```

This launches three services:

1. **Prompt server** (port 3847) — WebSocket server connecting the widget to Claude
2. **Widget Metro** (port 8082) — Serves the floating widget UI
3. **App Metro** (port 8081) — Standard Expo Metro for your app code

## Send your first prompt

1. Open your app on your device
2. Tap the floating bubble near the Dynamic Island
3. Type a prompt — for example: *"Add a login button to the home screen"*
4. Watch your code change in real-time as Claude writes it

The widget streams Claude's response and shows tool executions (file reads, writes, git operations) as they happen.

## Use the Changes tab

Tap the **Changes** tab in the widget to:

- See which files were modified (git diff)
- Commit changes with a message
- Create a pull request
- Switch branches (with automatic stashing)

<Callout type="info">
For development on a real device over a different network, use `npx expo-air fly` — it sets up Cloudflare tunnels and installs the app automatically. See [Remote Development](/docs/remote-development).
