## Widget not appearing

- Make sure you're running a **DEBUG** build. The widget is wrapped in `#if DEBUG` guards and won't appear in release builds.
- Check that `autoShow` is `true` in `.expo-air.json`.
- Run `expo prebuild --platform ios --clean` to re-apply native changes.
- Verify the config plugin is in your `app.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "plugins": ["@10play/expo-air"]
  }
  ```

## HMR disconnects

The [HMR auto-reconnect](/docs/how-it-works#hmr-auto-reconnect) module handles most disconnections automatically. If you're still experiencing issues:

- Check your tunnel status — restart with `expo-air start` if needed
- Ensure your device has stable WiFi or cellular connectivity
- Look for `[expo-air:hmr]` log messages in the console for reconnection status

## Tunnel rate limits

Cloudflare may rate-limit tunnel creation if you restart frequently in a short period. Options:

- Wait a few minutes before restarting
- Use `--no-tunnel` for local-only development:
  ```bash
  npx expo-air start --no-tunnel
  ```
- The CLI automatically falls back to localtunnel or bore if Cloudflare is unavailable

## Build fails after init

If `expo prebuild` fails during initialization:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
```

This runs a clean prebuild that reapplies all config plugin changes. The `--clean` flag removes the existing `ios/` directory first.

## Port conflicts

If a default port is already in use, specify different ports:

```bash
npx expo-air start \
  --port 4000 \
  --widget-port 8083 \
  --metro-port 8082
```

Default ports: prompt server (3847), widget Metro (8082), app Metro (8081).

## Widget bundle not loading

If the widget appears but shows a blank or loading state:

- Ensure Widget Metro is running on port 8082
- Check that `.expo-air.local.json` has the correct `widgetMetroUrl`
- Try setting the URL manually via environment variable:
  ```bash
  EXPO_AIR_METRO_URL=http://localhost:8082 npx expo-air start
  ```
